# Spam-Classfier
To classify the SMS tagged messages as SPAM or HAM using NLP Techniques

Modeled using three approaches: 
1. Spam Classifier using Stemming and Bag of words Model 
2. Spam Classifier using Lemmatization and Bag of words Model 
3. Spam Classifier using Lemmatization and tf-idf Model 

As the dataset is not large enough for tf-idf to be able to efficiently vectorise the words, the accuracy drops when using Lemmatization with tf-idf 
Accuracy of the three approaches: 
1. 98.56502242152466
2. 98.29596412556054
3. 97.21973094170404
